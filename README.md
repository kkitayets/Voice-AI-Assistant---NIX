Personal Voice AI Assistant in Python

The project is a personal voice AI assistant developed in Python. It is currently running on a local machine, but integration into the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform is planned in the future to ensure battery life and improve performance.

 Features

- Voice control: The assistant can recognize voice commands and perform appropriate actions.
- Text-to-speech: Uses speech synthesis to respond to user queries.
- Speech Recognition: Includes Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) function for processing voice commands.
- Integration with applications: It can open various applications and links using voice commands.
- Conversational interface: Supports a simple conversational interface with the possibility of short answers.

 Technologies

- Python: The main programming language.
- SpeechRecognition: A library for speech recognition.
- Google Generative AI: API is used to generate responses.
- Integration plans: It will be integrated into the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform to ensure battery life and improve performance.

 
 Future plans

- Integration with Jetson Nano: It is planned to transfer the assistant to the NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform to ensure battery life and improve performance.
- Improved speech recognition: It is planned to improve the accuracy of speech recognition using more advanced ASR models.
- Expansion of functionality: New functionality will be added, such as multi-language support and integration with other devices.
